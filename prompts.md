## Basic Chatbot generation
Create me a basic chatbot with the following spcifications:
- The input textarea should be fixed to the bottom of the page
- The chat display area should be infinite scroll
- The chat display should be able to display and interpret .md syntax.
- It should have a functional light/dark switch(should be an on/off button) at the bottom of the page
- It should have an LLM selector dropdown, I will implement myself the LLM selection
- Send button next to the textarea
- At the bottom of the page, the following should be grouped next to each other horizontallt in this oder: input textarea, send button, LLM selector, light/dark theme switch.
Final instructions:
- Do not generate any python code.
- Only generate the index.html page, the style.css, and the script.js files.
- I will implement myself the backend part, and all that remains.

## Create 3 separate categories: Chat, Companies, News
Transform the index page to contain 3 tiles: Chat, Companies, News
.ccs will be in a single file, so update style.ccs only, do not put css in the html files
.js scripts will be in a single file, so update script.js oly, do not put javascript in the html files
Create a new .html page for each tile
All pages will contain a functional light/dark switch, just as in index.html currently
Each page will have the hamburger menu, with quick access to each page, just as it is now by index.html
The index.html page will become chat.html
The news.html page will contain a few finance news from today
The companies.html:
- will contain a table with a list of 10 companies with some basic financial information
- each column should have up and down arrows for sorting
- the sorting functionality should not be implemented
- the list of 10 companies should be html only, i will design the data prototype for it myself
